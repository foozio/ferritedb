## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - Production Ready

FerriteDB 1.0.0 marks the first production-ready release of our Rust-based backend-as-a-service solution. This release includes all core features needed to build modern applications with a single binary deployment.

**Key Highlights:**
- ðŸš€ **Single Binary Deployment**: Start a complete backend with `ferritedb serve`
- ðŸ”’ **Security First**: Built-in authentication, authorization, and security hardening
- âš¡ **High Performance**: Async Rust with optimized SQLite operations
- ðŸŽ¯ **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive API, admin UI, and documentation
- ðŸ“¦ **Production Ready**: Docker support, health checks, and monitoring

**Migration from 0.x:**
This is the first stable release. If you were using pre-release versions, please refer to the migration guide in the documentation.

**Breaking Changes:**
- Configuration format has been standardized (see ferritedb.toml example)
- API endpoints have been finalized with consistent naming
- Database schema has been optimized (automatic migration provided)

**Security Notes:**
- Default JWT secret must be changed in production
- Admin interface requires HTTPS in production
- File upload validation is enabled by default
- Audit logging captures all administrative actions

**Performance:**
- Optimized for single-node deployments up to 10,000 concurrent users
- SQLite WAL mode enabled for better concurrent access
- Connection pooling and query optimization implemented
- Memory usage optimized for long-running deployments

**Known Issues:**
- Large file uploads (>100MB) may timeout on slow connections
- WebSocket connections are limited to 1,000 concurrent per instance
- Full-text search is basic (advanced search planned for v1.1)

**Upgrade Path:**
For future versions, we commit to:
- Semantic versioning with clear breaking change communication
- Automatic database migrations
- Backward compatibility within major versions
- Clear migration guides for breaking changes
